    <h2>The Best American Dish</h2>
    <p>A grilled cheese may have been one of the first things you learned to cook. It’s an easy, two-ingredient (well, three if you include butter) recipe that’s been perfected by many home cooks. But even the best grilled cheese makers may struggle to create that picture perfect, diner-style grilled cheese with edge to edge golden bread and perfectly melted cheese.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread the mayo on one side of the bread.</li>
        <li>Spread butter on the other side.</li>
        <li>Put cheese in the middle.</li>
        <li>Cook in the pan until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
